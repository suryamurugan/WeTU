<p>An extensive  survey training involving investigation and design of the following projects is  to be conducted for 2 weeks (14 days). The student shall submit a project  report consisting of designs and drawings. <strong>(Drawings should be done using  AutoCAD)</strong></p>
<p>1. General  instructions, Reconnaissance of the sites and fly leveling to establish bench  marks.</p>
<p>2. <strong>NEW TANK  PROJECTS: </strong>The work shall consist of <br />
  i) Alignment of  center line of the proposed bund, Longitudinal and cross sections of the center  line.<br />
  ii) Capacity  surveys.<br />
  iii) Details at  Waste weir and sluice points.<br />
