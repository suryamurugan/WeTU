  Course  Aim – The MSP430 microcontroller is ideally suited for development of low-power  embedded systems that must run on batteries for many years.<br />
  There  are also applications where MSP430 microcontroller must operate on energy  harvested from the environment. This is possible due to the ultra-low power  operation of MSP430 and the fact that it provides a complete system<br />
  solution  including a RISC CPU, flash memory, on-chip data converters and on-chip  peripherals.</p>
<h3>UNIT 7:</h3>
