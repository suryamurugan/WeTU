<h2 align="center">PART - A</h2>
<p><strong>Design, develop,  and implement the following programs in C / C++</strong></p>
<p>1. Program to  recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to from 3DSierpinski gasket. The number of  recursive steps is to be specifiedby the user.</p>
<p>2. Program to  implement Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm.</p>
<p>3. Program to draw  a color cube and spin it using OpenGLtransformation matrices.</p>
<p>4. Program to  create a house like figure and rotate it about a givenfixed point using OpenGL  functions.</p>
<p>5. Program to  implement the Cohen-Sutherland line-clippingalgorithm. Make provision to  specify the input line, window forclipping and view port for displaying the  clipped image.</p>
<p>6. Program to  create a cylinder and a parallelepiped by extruding acircle and quadrilateral  respectively. Allow the user to specify thecircle and the quadrilateral.</p>
<p>7. Program,  using OpenGL functions, to draw a simple shaded sceneconsisting of a tea pot on  a table. Define suitably the position andproperties of the light source along  with the properties of theproperties of the surfaces of the solid object used  in the scene.</p>
<p>8. Program to  draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camerasuitably to experiment  with perspective viewing. Use OpenGLfunctions.</p>
<p>9. Program to  fill any given polygon using scan-line area fillingalgorithm. (Use appropriate data  structures.)</p>
<p>10. Program to  display a set of values {fij} as a rectangular mesh.</p>

<h2 align="center">PART - B</h2>
<p>Develop a  suitable Graphics package to implement the skills learntin the theory and the  exercises indicated in Part A. Use the OpenGL.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br />
  1. Any question  from Part A may be asked in the examination.<br />
  2. A report of  about 10 â€“ 12 pages on the package developed in<br />
  Part B, duly  certified by the department must be submittedduring examination.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
  In the  examination, one exercise from Part A is to be asked for atotal of 30 marks.  The package developed under Part B has to beevaluated for a total of 20 marks.</p>
