    <br />
<p><strong>List of  Experiments for USP: </strong>Design,  develop, and execute thefollowing programs</p>
<p>1. Write a C/C++  POSIX compliant program to check the followinglimits:<br />
  (i) No. of clock  ticks (ii) Max.no. of child processes<br />
  (iii) Max. path  length<br />
  (iv) Max. no. of  characters in a file name<br />
  (v) Max. no.of  open files/ process</p>
<p>2. Write a C/C++  POSIX compliant program that prints the POSIXdefined configuration options  supported on any given system usingfeature test macros.</p>
<p>3. Consider the  last 100 bytes as a region. Write a C/C++ program tocheck whether the region is  locked or not. If the region is locked,print pid of the process which has  locked. If the region is not locked,lock the region with an exclusive lock,  read the last 50 bytes andunlock the region.</p>
<p>4. Write a C/C++  program which demonstrates interprocesscommunication between a reader process  and a writer process. Usemkfifo, open, read, write and close APIs in your  program.</p>
<p>5. a) Write a  C/C++ program that outputs the contents of itsEnvironment list<br />
  b) Write a C /  C++ program to emulate the unix<strong>ln</strong>command</p>
<p>6. Write a C/C++  program to illustrate the race condition.</p>
<p>7. Write a C/C++  program that creates a zombie and then calls systemto execute the <strong>ps</strong>command  to verify that the process is zombie.</p>
<p>8. Write a C/C++  program to avoid zombie process by forking twice.</p>
<p>9. Write a C/C++  program to implement the <strong>system </strong>function.</p>
<p>10. Write a  C/C++ program to set up a real-time clock interval timerusing the <strong>alarm </strong>API.</p>
<p><strong>List of  Experiments for Compiler Design: </strong>Design, develop, andexecute the  following programs.</p>
<p>11. Write a C  program to implement the syntax-directed definition of “ifE then S1” and “if E  then S1 else S2”. (Refer Fig. 8.23 in the textbook prescribed for 06CS62  Compiler Design, Alfred V Aho, RaviSethi, and Jeffrey D Ullman: Compilers-  Principles, Techniques andTools, 2nd Edition, Pearson Education, 2007).</p>
<p>12. Write a yacc  program that accepts a regular expression as input andproduce its parse tree as  output.</p>
<p><strong>Note: In the  examination <em>each </em>student picks one question fromthe lot of <em>all </em>12  questions.</strong><a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a></p>
