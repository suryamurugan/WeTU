<p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong><strong> </strong>In order to  acquire a sound understanding of the subject, it is desirable for the students  to work in the laboratory using OpenMP. The hands-on experience would reinforce  the concepts learnt in theory. Problems<br />
  similar to the  ones solved in the Algorithms Laboratory can be solved and issues like speed-up  achieved can be analyzed in depth. Several free tools are available from  companies like INTEL to facilitate such a study.</p>
