<h2 align="center">PART – A</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Design,  develop, and implement the following programs</strong></p>
<p>1.  Write a C++ program to read series of names, one per line, from standard input  and write these names spelled in reverse order to the standard output using I/O  redirection and pipes. Repeat the exercise using an input file specified by the  user instead of the standard input and using an output file specified by the  user instead of the standard output.<br />
  2.  Write a C++ program to read and write student objects with fixedlength records  and the fields delimited by “|”. Implement pack ( ), unpack ( ), modify ( ) and  search ( ) methods.</p>
<p>3.  Write a C++ program to read and write student objects with Variable - Length  records using any suitable record structure. Implement pack ( ), unpack ( ),  modify ( ) and search ( ) methods.</p>
<p>4.  Write a C++ program to write student objects with Variable - Length records  using any suitable record structure and to read from this file a student record  using RRN.</p>
<p>5.  Write a C++ program to implement simple index on primary key for a file of  student objects. Implement add ( ), search ( ), delete ( ) using the index.</p>
<p>6.  Write a C++ program to implement index on secondary key, the name, for a file  of student objects. Implement add ( ), search ( ), delete ( ) using the  secondary index.</p>
<p>7.  Write a C++ program to read two lists of names and then match the names in the  two lists using Cosequential Match based on a single loop. Output the names  common to both the lists.</p>
<p>8.  Write a C++ program to read k Lists of names and merge them using k-way merge  algorithm with k = 8.</p>
<p>9.  Write a C++ program to implement B-Tree for a given set of integers and its  operations insert ( ) and search ( ). Display the tree.</p>
<p>10.  Write a C++ program to implement B+ tree for a given set of integers and its  operations insert ( ), and search ( ). Display the tree.</p>
<p>11.  Write a C++ program to store and retrieve student data from file using hashing.  Use any collision resolution technique.</p>
<p>12.  Write a C++ program to reclaim the free space resulting from the deletion of  records using linked lists.</p>
<p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong><strong> In  the examination <em>each </em>student picks one question from the lot of <em>all </em>12  questions.</strong></p>
