<p align="center" class="Syllabus_Code"><strong>(Common  to CSE &amp; ISE)</strong><br />
  <strong>Subject  Code: 10CSL48</strong><br />
<p><strong><u>Notes:</u></strong><br />
  · <strong>Develop and  execute the following programs using 8086Assembly Language. Any suitable  assembler like MASM,TASM etc may be used.</strong><br />
  · <strong>Program should  have suitable comments.</strong><br />
  · <strong>The board layout  and the circuit diagram of the interface areto be provided to the student  during the examination.</strong></p>
<p>1. a) Search a  key element in a list of ‘n’ 16-bit numbers using theBinary search algorithm.<br />
  b) Read the  status of eight input bits from the Logic ControllerInterface and display ‘FF’  if it is the parity of the input read iseven; otherwise display 00.</p>
<p>2. a) Write two  ALP modules stored in two different files; one moduleis to read a character  from the keyboard and the other one is todisplay a character. Use the above two  modules to read a string ofcharacters from the keyboard terminated by the  carriage returnand print the string on the display in the next line.<br />
  b) Implement a  BCD Up-Down Counter on the Logic ControllerInterface.</p>
<p>3. a) Sort a  given set of ‘n’ numbers in ascending order using theBubble Sort algorithm.<br />
  b) Read the  status of two 8-bit inputs (X &amp; Y) from the LogicController Interface and  display X*Y.</p>
<p>4. a) Read an  alphanumeric character and display its equivalent ASCIIcode at the center of  the screen.<br />
  b) Display  messages FIRE and HELP alternately with flickeringeffects on a 7-segment  display interface for a suitable period oftime. Ensure a flashing rate that  makes it easy to read both themessages (Examiner does not specify these delay  values nor is itnecessary for the student to compute these values).</p>
<p>5. a) Reverse a  given string and check whether it is a palindrome ornot.<br />
  b) Assume any  suitable message of 12 characters length and displayit in the rolling fashion  on a 7-segment display interface for asuitable period of time. Ensure a  flashing rate that makes it easy toread both the messages. (Examiner does not  specify these delayvalues nor is it necessary for the student to compute these  values).</p>
<p>6. a) Read two  strings, store them in locations STR1 and STR2. Checkwhether they are equal or  not and display appropriate messages.Also display the length of the stored  strings.<br />
  b) Convert a  16-bit binary value (assumed to be an unsigned integer)to BCD and display it  from left to right and right to left forspecified number of times on a  7-segment display interface.</p>
<p>7. a) Read your  name from the keyboard and display it at a specifiedlocation on the screen  after the message “<strong>What is your name?”</strong>You must clear the entire screen  before display.<br />
  b) Scan a 8 x 3  keypad for key closure and to store the code of thekey pressed in a memory  location or display on screen. Alsodisplay row and column numbers of the key  pressed.</p>
<p>8. a) Compute <strong>nCr</strong> using  recursive procedure. Assume that ‘n’ and ‘r’are non-negative integers.<br />
  b) Drive a  Stepper Motor interface to rotate the motor in specifieddirection (clockwise or  counter-clockwise) by N steps (Directionand N are specified by the examiner).  Introduce suitable delaybetween successive steps. (Any arbitrary value for the  delay maybe assumed by the student).</p>
<p>9. a) Read the  current time from the system and display it in thestandard format on the  screen.<br />
  b) Generate the  Sine Wave using DAC interface (The output of theDAC is to be displayed on the  CRO).</p>
<p>10. a) Write a  program to simulate a Decimal Up-counter to display 00-99.<br />
  b) Generate a  Half Rectified Sine wave form using the DACinterface. (The output of the DAC is  to be displayed on the CRO).</p>
<p>11. a) Read a  pair of input co-ordinates in BCD and move the cursor tothe specified location  on the screen.<br />
  b) Generate a  Fully Rectified Sine waveform using the DACinterface. (The output of the DAC is  to be displayed on the CRO).</p>
<p>12. a) Write a  program to create a file (input file) and to delete an existing file.<br />
  b) Drive an  elevator interface in the following way:<br />
  i. Initially the  elevator should be in the ground floor, with allrequests in OFF state.<br />
  ii. When a request  is made from a floor, the elevator shouldmove to that floor, wait there for a  couple of seconds<br />
  (approximately),  and then come down to ground floor andstop. If some requests occur during going  up or coming<br />
  down they should  be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Note: In the  examination <em>each </em>student picks one question fromthe lot of <em>all </em>12  questions.</strong></p>
