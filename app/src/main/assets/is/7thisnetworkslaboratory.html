    <br />
<p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong><strong> Student is  required to solve one problem from PART-A and oneproblem from PART-B. The  questions are allotted based on lots. Bothquestions carry equal marks.</strong></p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="_Toc337586211" id="_Toc337586211">PART A –  Simulation Exercises</a></h2>
<p><strong>The following  experiments shall be conducted using eitherNS228/OPNET or any other suitable  simulator.</strong><br />
  1. Simulate a  three nodes point – to – point network with duplex linksbetween them. Set the  queue size and vary the bandwidth and find thenumber of packets dropped.<br />
  2. Simulate a  four node point-to-point network with the links connected asfollows:<br />
  n0 – n2, n1 – n2  and n2 – n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDPbetween n1-n3. Apply relevant  applications over TCP and UDP agentschanging the parameter and determine the  number of packets sent byTCP / UDP.<br />
  3. Simulate the  transmission of ping messages over a network topologyconsisting of 6 nodes and  find the number of packets dropped due tocongestion.<br />
  4. Simulate an  Ethernet LAN using n nodes (6-10), change error rate anddata rate and compare  throughput.<br />
  5. Simulate an  Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodesand plot congestion  window for different source / destination.<br />
  6. Simulate  simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN bysimulation and  determine the performance with respect to transmission ofpackets.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="_Toc337586212" id="_Toc337586212">PART-B</a></h2>
<p><strong>Implement the  following in C/C++:</strong><br />
  7. Write a  program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).</p>
<p>8. Write a  program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path fortransmission.</p>
<p>9. Using TCP/IP  sockets, write a client – server program to make the clientsend the file name  and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.</p>
<p>10. Implement  the above program using as message queues or FIFOs as IPCchannels.</p>
<p>11. Write a  program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt thedata.</p>
<p>12. Write a  program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.</p>

<p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong><br />
  In the  examination, a combination of one problem has to be asked fromPart A for a  total of 25 marks and one problem from Part B has to beasked for a total of 25  marks. The choice must be based on random<br />
  selection from  the entire lots.</p>
