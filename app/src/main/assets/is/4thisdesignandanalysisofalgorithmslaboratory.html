  <strong>Subject  Code: 10CSL47</strong><br />
<p><strong>Design, develop  and implement the specified algorithms for thefollowing problems using C/C++  Language in LINUX /Windows environment.</strong></p>
<p>1. Sort a given  set of elements using the Quicksort method anddetermine the time required to  sort the elements. Repeat theexperiment for different values of n, the number  of elements in thelist to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus  n.<br />
  The elements can  be read from a file or can be generated using therandom number generator.</p>
<p>2. Using OpenMP,  implement a parallelized Merge Sort algorithm tosort a given set of elements  and determine the time required to sortthe elements. Repeat the experiment for  different values of n, thenumber of elements in the list to be sorted and plot  a graph of thetime taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can  begenerated using the random number generator.</p>
<p>3. a. Obtain the  Topological ordering of vertices in a given digraph.<br />
  b. Compute the  transitive closure of a given directed graph usingWarshall's algorithm.</p>
<p>4. Implement 0/1  Knapsack problem using DynamicProgramming.</p>
<p>5. From a given  vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortestpaths to other vertices  using Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
<p>6. Find Minimum  Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graphusing Kruskal's algorithm.</p>
<p>7. a. Print all  the nodes reachable from a given starting node in adigraph using BFS method.<br />
  b. Check whether  a given graph is connected or not using DFSmethod.</p>
<p>8. Find a subset  of a given set S = {sl, s2,.....,sn} of n positive  integerswhose sum is equal to a given positive integer d. For example, if S={1,  2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 there are two solutions{1,2,6}and{1,8}.Asuitable message  is to be displayed if the given problem instancedoesn't have a solution.</p>
<p>9. Implement any  scheme to find the optimal solution for the TravelingSalesperson problem and  then solve the same problem instanceusing any approximation algorithm and  determine the error in theapproximation.</p>
<p>10. Find Minimum  Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graphusing Primâ€™s algorithm.</p>
<p>11. Implement  All-Pairs Shortest Paths Problem using Floyd'salgorithm. Parallelize this  algorithm, implement it using OpenMPand determine the speed-up achieved.</p>
<p>12. Implement N  Queen's problem using Back Tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Note: In the  examination <em>each </em>student picks one question fromthe lot of <em>all </em>12  questions.</strong></p>
