    <br/>
<p>1.  Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the triangle  problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are supposed to be the  three sides of a triangle and determine if the three values represent an  equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they do not form  a triangle at all. Derive test<br />
cases  for your program based on decision-table approach, execute the test cases and  discuss the results.</p>
<p>2.  Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the triangle  problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are supposed to be the  three sides of a triangle and determine if the three values represent an  equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they do not form  a triangle at all. Assume that<br />
  the  upper limit for the size of any side is 10. Derive test cases for your program  based on boundary-value analysis, execute the test cases and discuss the  results.</p>
<p>3.  Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the triangle  problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are supposed to be the  three sides of a triangle and determine if the three values represent an  equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they do not form  a triangle at all. Assume that<br />
  the  upper limit for the size of any side is 10. Derive test cases for your program  based on equivalence class partitioning, execute the test cases and discuss the  results.</p>

<p><strong><u>Notes:</u></strong><br />
  · <strong>In the examination <em>each </em>student picks one question from the  lot of <em>all </em>12 questions.</strong><br />
  · <strong>The programs must be executed in UNIX / LINUX environment.</strong></p>
