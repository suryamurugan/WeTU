<h2 align="center">PART - A</h2>
<h3>LEX and YACC Programs:</h3>
<p><strong>Design, develop, and execute the following programs  using LEX:</strong><br />
  <strong>1</strong>. a) Program to count the number of  characters, words, spaces and lines in a given input file.<br />
  b) Program to  count the numbers of comment lines in a given Cprogram. Also eliminate them and  copy the resulting programinto separate file.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. a) Program to recognize a valid  arithmetic expression and torecognize the identifiers and operators present.  Print themseparately.<br />
  b) Program to  recognize whether a given sentence is simple orcompound.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. Program to recognize and count the  number of identifiers in a giveninput file.</p>
<p><strong>Design, develop, and execute the following programs  using YACC:</strong><br />
  <strong>4</strong>. a) Program to recognize a valid  arithmetic expression that usesoperators +, -, * and /.<br />
  b) Program to  recognize a valid variable, which starts with a letter,followed by any number  of letters or digits.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. a) Program to evaluate an arithmetic  expression involving operators+, -, * and /.<br />
  b) Program to  recognize strings ‘aaab’, ‘abbb’, ‘ab’ and ‘a’ usingthe grammar (anbn, n&gt;= 0).</p>
<p><strong>6</strong>. Program to recognize the grammar (anb, n&gt;= 10).</p>

<h2 align="center">PART B</h2>
<h3>UNIX Programming:</h3>
<p><strong>Design, develop, and execute the following programs:</strong><br />
  <strong>7</strong>. a) Non-recursive shell script that  accepts any number ofarguments and prints them in the Reverse order, ( For  example,if the script is named rargs, then executing rargs A B C shouldproduce  C B A on the standard output).<br />
  b) C program  that creates a child process to read commands fromthe standard input and  execute them (a minimal implementationof a shell – like program). You can  assume that no argumentswill be passed to the commands to be executed.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>. a) Shell script that accepts two file  names as arguments, checks ifthe permissions for these files are identical and  if the permissionsare identical, outputs the common permissions, otherwise  outputseach file name followed by its permissions.<br />
  b) C program to  create a file with 16 bytes of arbitrary data from thebeginning and another 16  bytes of arbitrary data from an offsetof 48. Display the file contents to  demonstrate how the hole infile is handled.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong>. a) Shell script that accepts file  names specified as arguments andcreates a shell script that contains this file  as well as the code torecreate these files. Thus if the script generated by  your script isexecuted, it would recreate the original files(This is same as  the“bundle” script described by Brain W. Kernighan and Rob Pikein “ The Unix  Programming Environment”, Prentice – HallIndia).<br />
  b) C program to  do the following: Using fork( ) create a childprocess. The child process prints  its own process-id and id ofits parent and then exits. The parent process waits  for its child tofinish (by executing the wait( )) and prints its own process-id  andthe id of its child process and then exits.</p>
<h3>Operating Systems:</h3>
<p><strong>10</strong>. Design, develop and execute a program  in C / C++ to simulate theworking of Shortest Remaining Time and Round-Robin  SchedulingAlgorithms. Experiment with different quantum sizes for the  Round-Robin algorithm. In all cases, determine the average turn-aroundtime. The  input can be read from key board or from a file.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong>. Using OpenMP, Design, develop and run  a multi-threaded programto generate and print Fibonacci Series. One thread has  to generatethe numbers up to the specified limit and another thread has to  printthem. Ensure proper synchronization.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong>. Design, develop and run a program to  implement the Banker’sAlgorithm. Demonstrate its working with different data  values.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
  In the  examination, a combination of one LEX and one YACCproblem has to be asked from  Part A for a total of 30 marks and oneprogramming exercise from Part B has to  be asked for a total of 20marks.</p>
